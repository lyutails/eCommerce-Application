## Project's Purposes

Create during `Four Sprints` fully functional `eCommerce Application` with every Sprints' tasks done to the fullest and in time.

Project should have astonishing / just incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing real art design with good UI and UX... kinda eyes popping ðŸ‘€, jaw dropping ðŸ‘„, heart stopping ðŸ’–.

Gonna keep healthy atmoshpere and good mood of all teams' members and our server's allies while working in close collaboration with each other, also hosting daily meetups, doesn't matter what difficulties with the task we'll meet on the way.

Deeply in the core of the project should create consistent code base, following principles of SRP, DRY, KISS.

Also appear in the Top works with this our final project after voting at the end of the course.

**NB**:

1. naming

- `branches` names are in kebab-case and have prefix of assigner name (i.e. red-awesome-branch, yana-wow-branch, cherry-kinda-branch etc.)
- names of **components** creating **visual** part of application (so called silly) are in `PascalCase` as well as their files' and folders' names (e.g. Main, Card, Auth, App etc.)
- all other folders and files, except components' ones, are in `kebab-case` (e.g. awesome-folder, cool-new-file etc.)
- classic clever functions exposing **behaviour** are in `camelCase` and start with verb (e.g. makeMyDay)
- **const** and **let** variables are in `camelCase` (e.g. niceNewThing)

2. .scss file for each .tsx file and one global .scss file with imports

3. .scss files have names mirroring corresponding .tsx files' names

4. using [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) with scss modules alongside with scss nesting where it's necessary in components

5. workflow's based on functions and hooks

8. separated **logic** (business logic / data control) and the app's **UI** (how the app looks like / appearance)

9. architecture idea is based on FSD (Feature Sliced Design) and Component Apporach
